# Branch Prediction Algorithms in Java

## Introduction

This project implements various branch prediction algorithms in Java. Branch prediction is a crucial aspect of modern computer architecture, as it helps optimize the performance of pipelined processors by predicting the outcome of conditional branches in programs.

The following branch prediction algorithms are included in this project:

- Correlation Predictor
- Tournament Predictor
- Two-Level Predictor
- gShare Predictor
- Bimodal Predictor

The following automatons are included in this project:

- 1-Bit Predictor
- 2-Bit Predictors (4 types)
- 3-Bit Automatons
